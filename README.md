Hey, I had great experience doing this assessment.


# CloudFormation Template

The cloudformation template will create the following : 
- SNS Topic with SQS Subscription 
- s3 Bucket with Versioning and LifeCycle conffiguration 
- A Lambda function which stores SQS message body in S3 Bucket
- All neccessary Roles and policies

To increase the efficiency and security of the stack we can do the following :
- Make s3 bucket private
- Enable Encryption 


It would be a sincere pleasure to hear back from you soon to discuss this exciting opportunity.
